For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me. This is the bread which came down from heaven, not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live for ever.” - John 6:52-58", "After the above passage, many discples take Jesus literally and say 'This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?' and instead of correcting them Jesus responds saying 'Do you take offense at this? Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before?' - John 6:60-62", "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself - 1 Corinthians 12:27-29"],
